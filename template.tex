Our application implements the page turning algorithm specified by \cite{Lichan-Hong:2004fk} and implemented in OpenGL by \cite{Nuon:uq}.


\section{Implementation}
\subsection{Page Curling}
Page curling is a combination of a parameterized transformation approximating a cone  of varying width and position and a rotation about the y-axis.

The shape and position of the cone varies in three phases to simulate the severe curling that occurs at the start, more flat turning in the middle, and finally the wobble of settling onto the resting state. the attributes of the cone are calculated in Javascript then passed to WebGL shaders as uniforms.

The vertex shader calculates its projection onto the cone as a function of its two-dimensional position on the page's plane. 



\subsection{Two-Sided Textures}
A single mesh is used for each page, which has a different texture for each side. To determine the correct texture for a given fragment, a normal vector is passed for each vertex.

Singe each page is a parameterized plane, the vertex shader can calculate the position of vertices a small $\delta$ in either direction.

The normal vector is passed to the fragment shader, which determines if the normal is facing toward or away from the camera and picks the appropriate texture.
%\subsection{Queueing}
%Pages sit in a stack on either side of the active turning page, and are raised into the turning position as needed.


\section{Conclusion}

WebGL offers a powerful environment for 3D presentation on the web. While libraries such as three.js can offer significant advantages, implementation can still be challenging.
