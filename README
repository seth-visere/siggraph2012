This README file accompanies the 2008/10/21 version of the 'acmsiggraph'
LaTeX files, to be used to prepare documents for publication in the print
and/or electronic proceedings of events sponsored by ACM SIGGRAPH.

Files included in this package include:

  README          - this file

  acmsiggraph.bst - BibTeX style file
  acmsiggraph.cls - LaTeX class file

  template.tex    - sample source document
  template.bib    - sample BibTeX document
  sample.eps      - EPS file used in 'template.tex'

  template-review.pdf           - PDF of 'review' mode document
  template-final.pdf            - PDF of 'final' mode document, 
                                  prepared for sponsored event
				  that is not the annual conference.
  template-final-annualconf.pdf - PDF of 'final' mode document,
                                  prepared for annual conference.
  template-final-nocr.pdf       - PDF of 'final' mode document,
                                  prepared without space left for
				  the ACM copyright information.

Four versions of the template document are distributed with this package
to illustrate the commonly-used variants. Of special note is the 
'template-final-nocr.pdf' which does not leave any space for the ACM
copyright information, added during production. This example is not to be
used as guidance for technical papers accepted to a sponsored event or 
annual conference, but can be used as an example of a poster, talk, or
other content accepted at a sponsored event.

Questions, comments, and suggestions should be sent to Stephen Spencer at
'spencer@cs.washington.edu' to be considered for inclusion in a future 
version of this package.
